//Invoking a function suspends the execution of the current function, 
//passing control and parameters to the new function.

//In addition to the declared parameters, 
//every function receives two additional parameters: 
// 'this' and 'arguments'. 

//The 'this' parameter value is determined by
//the invocation pattern

//There are four patterns of invocation in JavaScript: 
// 1. method invocation pattern
// 2. function invocation pattern
// 3. constructor invocation pattern
// 4. apply invocation pattern

//The patterns differ in how the bonus parameter this is initialized.
